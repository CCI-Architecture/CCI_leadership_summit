<p><strong>Position:</strong> Senior Manager, IT Infrastructure</p>
<p><strong>Work Quote:</strong> If you don’t have time to do it right, when are you going to have time to do it again?</p>
<p><strong>Leadership Philosophy:</strong> 1. Do It Right the First Time
	•	“If you don’t have time to do it right, when are you going to have time to do it again?” is more than a quote—it’s a principle.
	•	Precision, accuracy, and quality are non-negotiable; shortcuts lead to inefficiencies and rework.
	•	We operate with the mindset that every task, project, or solution should be built to last, scalable, and maintainable.

2. Lead by Example
	•	Leadership is about setting the standard—not just expecting it from others.
	•	I work alongside my team, not above them. No task is beneath a leader when the goal is success.
	•	My actions, commitment, and integrity will define expectations more than words ever could.

3. Technical Excellence &amp; Business Acumen
	•	We are not just IT professionals; we are business enablers.
	•	Technical expertise must be paired with a deep understanding of how our work drives company success.
	•	Our team is the go-to resource because we bridge technology with business needs seamlessly.

4. Ownership &amp; Accountability
	•	Every team member takes full ownership of their responsibilities—problems are not just identified but solved.
	•	If an issue arises, we don’t point fingers—we step in, fix it, and learn from it.
	•	Reliability is our currency; trust is our foundation.

5. Continuous Learning &amp; Improvement
	•	Technology evolves, and so must we. Staying ahead requires curiosity, training, and a commitment to growth.
	•	We push boundaries, embrace innovation, and refine processes to keep delivering excellence.
	•	We document, automate, and optimize to work smarter, not harder.

6. Efficiency Through Smart Work
	•	Speed without accuracy is wasteful; efficiency is about delivering the right solution the first time.
	•	We prioritize automation, proactive problem-solving, and strategic thinking over firefighting.
	•	The goal is to spend time improving, not repeatedly fixing the same issues.

7. Service-Oriented Mindset
	•	IT is a service, and our reputation is built on responsiveness, technical mastery, and business alignment.
	•	We don’t just solve problems; we anticipate them.
	•	Collaboration with stakeholders is key—understanding their needs ensures our solutions have impact.</p>

<p><strong>What Demotivates Me:</strong> List any major demotivators:: I am most demotivated by inefficiency, complacency, and a lack of accountability. When problems are repeatedly addressed with temporary fixes instead of lasting solutions, it goes against my core belief in doing things right the first time. I thrive in environments where people take ownership, continuously improve, and push for excellence—so when there’s resistance to change or a reluctance to evolve, it can be frustrating.</p>

Credit stealing is another major demotivator—I believe in recognizing and appreciating the efforts of those who truly contribute. Similarly, judging people without understanding their challenges is something I strongly dislike. Everyone has their own struggles, and making assumptions without stepping into their shoes goes against the principles of fairness and empathy that I value.

<p><strong>Position:</strong> Security Automation Associate Manager</p>
<p><strong>Work Quote:</strong> "Efficiency is intelligent laziness." 
"Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication" 
and taken from Erik Elliot's Teams Status but stuck to my head ever since " "The consciousness of good intentions disdains ambiguity."</p>
<p><strong>Leadership Philosophy:</strong> I take a democratic approach to leadership. I make sure everyone feels involved, has a voice, and that their ideas are heard. A safe space for suggestions and discussions is key, and I validate new procedures or improvements with my team before rolling them out or discussing it with the chain of command.

I promote accountability by giving ownership to analysts and ensuring they feel confident to ask questions. I trust my team to handle their responsibilities, so there’s no micromanaging. Instead, I focus on removing roadblocks and making things smoother, so they can do their job effectively.

Knowledge transfer is a priority, and I believe in recurrent workshops, hands-on learning, and continuous upskilling, whether through internal sessions or external resources. Keeping the team learning and growing is just as important as keeping automation evolving.</p>
<p><strong>Top 5 Strengths:</strong> 1. Individualization
2. Learner
3. Achiever
4. Restorative
5. Strategic</p>
<p><strong>Describe what motivates you most at work:</strong> : What I do isn’t repetitive, it’s creative. Every project is different, and that’s what keeps it exciting. Each automation solves a unique challenge, and the impact is immediate. Teams get their time back to focus on more important tasks instead of manual, repetitive work. It’s not just about making things more efficient, it’s about enabling people to do higher-value work and making security operations stronger as a whole.

I also enjoy brainstorming and solving problems that others find too messy or complex, but always with a practical mindset. Technology is out there to make things easier, not harder, so I focus on efficiency and simplicity. Figuring out a better way to do things is what drives me. If something can be streamlined, automated, or improved, I’ll find a way to make it happen. I don’t believe in overcomplicating things when a straightforward, effective solution exists. My goal is to make security automation work seamlessly for the people who rely on it.

Beyond the technical work, I know I have a lot of influence, and my empathy helps me connect on a deeper level with colleagues. People often seek me out for both professional and personal advice and seeing them overcome challenges and grow is genuinely fulfilling.</p>

<p><strong>Position:</strong> IT Assurance Manager</p>
<p><strong>Work Quote:</strong> “It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.” - Teddy Roosevelt, 1910</p>
<p><strong>Leadership Philosophy:</strong> I approach leadership with a three-fold philosophy:

1. Hire people who are smarter than me and empower them to succeed. I don’t need to be the smartest person in the room—my goal is to build a team of highly capable individuals and give them the tools, training, and support they need to excel. By equipping them with the right knowledge and processes, we elevate both individual success and the success of the team as a whole.

2. Prioritize people first, employees second. I believe that caring about my team as individuals creates an environment where they can thrive. I take the time to understand what matters to them and support them accordingly. There’s a well-known saying: People don’t leave jobs; they leave managers. I want my team to feel valued and supported, knowing that I’m invested in their growth, well-being, and success—not just as employees, but as people. When they succeed, the team succeeds, and ultimately, Stryker benefits, as well.

3. Seek input and buy-in from the team. Leadership isn’t about dictating decisions—it’s about collaboration. While there are rare occasions where I have to make unilateral decisions, my default approach is to involve the team. I explain what needs to be done and why, then work with them to determine the best path forward. This ensures alignment, fosters ownership, and ultimately leads to better outcomes.</p>
<p><strong>Top 5 Strengths:</strong> Individualization, Strategic, Intellection, Empathy, Adaptability</p>
<p><strong>Describe what motivates you most at work:</strong> : Relationships! I don’t do things just for the sake of doing them; I do them for someone. When I work to complete tasks or to improve a process, efficiency and business impact are always on my radar, but my real motivation comes from understanding who will benefit from the work. It’s never just about what needs to be done; it’s about who it helps.

For example, when I think about the work my team does, I see it from both a high-level perspective - supporting patient safety in alignment with Stryker’s mission - but also through a more personal lens. If the FDA walked in tomorrow for an audit, I want the Stryker employee responsible for presenting validation evidence to have everything they need to succeed. I want them to easily find the right documentation and clearly understand the story behind it, so they can confidently navigate the conversation. That’s what drives me.

When I feel stressed or demotivated, I reconnect with that sense of purpose by reaching out to a colleague for a quick chat. A small moment of connection helps ground me.

I don’t work hard for the nameless, faceless Stryker; I work hard for the people around me and the patients we serve.</p>

<p><strong>Position:</strong> Associate SOC Manager</p>
<p><strong>Work Quote:</strong> "Leadership is not about being in charge. It is about taking care of those in your charge." — Simon Sinek</p>
<p><strong>Leadership Philosophy:</strong> My leadership philosophy is simple: take care of your people, and they will take care of the business. I lead by example, empower others, foster trust, and build strong relationships with my team. This foundation gives me the confidence that, even when challenges arise, the team is always ready to step up and support each other.</p>
<p><strong>Top 5 Strengths:</strong> Focus
Achiever
Futuristic
Restorative
Competition</p>
<p><strong>Describe what motivates you most at work:</strong> : What drives me most is seeing people grow, both as professionals and as individuals. I’m genuinely passionate about cybersecurity and thrive in an environment where there is always something new to learn and improve. I find purpose in building high-performing teams, creating real cyber talent, and fostering a culture where people feel confident taking ownership and delivering results. I value the trust and strong relationships I build with my team, knowing they can face challenges and succeed even without my direct involvement.

I’m always striving for progress, whether it is through continuous improvement, driving meaningful impact, or pushing to be better every day. I stay focused on what matters, challenge myself and my team to aim higher, and constantly look ahead to anticipate what is next so we can be prepared and stay ahead of the curve. Most importantly, I never forget that what we do in cyber goes beyond technology. We help protect lives, and that purpose connects me to this work in a deeper way and keeps me inspired every day.</p>

<p><strong>Positions Held:</strong> (List 3 high-level roles that are relevant to your career path) : - Manager of Technical Security Teams (e.g. Threat Hunting, Red Team, Threat Intelligence, SOC/IR) Something related with AI could be amazing!

- Director/Senior Director of Cybersecurity

I value the rotational development model, like the one CCI promotes, where leaders gain experience across different areas of cybersecurity. While my background is in SOC and IR, I believe stepping into domains like threat intelligence, offensive security, GRC, AI or strategy builds stronger, more well-rounded leadership.

One of my key strengths is thinking ahead. I’m passionate about exploring what’s next—whether it’s AI, automation, or emerging technologies—and I’m motivated by roles that let me contribute to future-focused strategy and innovation.</p>
